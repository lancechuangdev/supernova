# pledgev2 rebuild

This is a clean Hardhat project for rebuilding the `pledgev2` contracts with codex asistant. It is intended to test AI's capabilities and explore best practices for AI-assisted development.

The original folders are left alone. Each rebuild checkpoint should add only the contracts and tests needed for that step.

## Step 1

Contracts:

- `contracts/token/LearningDebtToken.sol`
- `contracts/oracle/LearningMockOracle.sol`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm install
npm run test:step1
```

Learning goal:

- Understand SP/JP-style receipt tokens as mintable/burnable ERC20 claim tokens.
- Understand a simple owner-controlled mock oracle before using price math inside a lending pool.

## Step 2

Contracts:

- `contracts/pool/LearningPledgePool.sol`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step2
```

Learning goal:

- Store the fixed-term pool configuration.
- Understand the pool lifecycle enum before adding deposits.
- Keep admin-only pool creation separate from user-facing lending and borrowing flows.

## Step 3

Contract changes:

- `LearningPledgePool.depositLend`
- `LearningPledgePool.userLendInfo`
- `LearningPledgePool.minLendAmount`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step3
```

Learning goal:

- Move lender funds into the pool with ERC20 `approve` + `transferFrom`.
- Track lender stake amount separately from total pool lend supply.
- Enforce the first user-facing gates: paused state, settlement time, min amount, and max pool capacity.

## Step 4

Contract changes:

- `LearningPledgePool.depositBorrow`
- `LearningPledgePool.userBorrowInfo`
- `LearningPledgePool.minBorrowAmount`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step4
```

Learning goal:

- Move borrower collateral into the pool with ERC20 `approve` + `transferFrom`.
- Track borrower collateral separately from lender stablecoin deposits.
- Understand that borrowers do not receive the loan yet; matched loan payout happens after settlement.

## Step 5

Contract changes:

- `LearningPledgePool.PoolDataInfo`
- `LearningPledgePool.getPoolData`
- `LearningPledgePool.settle`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step5
```

Learning goal:

- Convert borrower collateral value into lender-token value using oracle prices.
- Apply the mortgage/collateralization rate to find the maximum matched loan amount.
- Move pools from `MATCH` to `EXECUTION`, or to `UNDONE` when one side is empty.

## Step 6

Contract changes:

- `LearningPledgePool.refundLend`
- `LearningPledgePool.refundBorrow`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step6
```

Learning goal:

- Return unmatched lender stablecoin when borrower collateral cannot support the full lend supply.
- Return unmatched borrower collateral when lender demand does not need all collateral.
- Keep refund accounting separate from the later SP/JP claim flow.

## Step 7

Contract changes:

- `LearningPledgePool.claimLend`
- `LearningPledgePool.claimBorrow`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step7
```

Learning goal:

- Mint SP tokens to lenders for their matched stablecoin contribution.
- Mint JP tokens to borrowers for their matched collateral contribution.
- Send borrowers their matched stablecoin loan only after settlement.

## Step 8

Contract changes:

- `contracts/dex/LearningDexRouter.sol`
- `LearningPledgePool.setDexRouter`
- `LearningPledgePool.repayPool`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step8
```

Learning goal:

- Swap matched borrower collateral into lender repayment token at repay.
- Use a max-collateral input as slippage protection.
- Keep remaining collateral available for JP holders after the DEX swap.

## Step 9

Contract changes:

- `LearningPledgePool.isLiquidatable`
- `LearningPledgePool.liquidate`
- liquidation-aware `withdrawLend`
- liquidation-aware `withdrawBorrow`

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step9
```

Learning goal:

- Detect unhealthy collateral using current oracle prices.
- Sell collateral through the DEX before normal repayment.
- Distribute liquidation proceeds to SP holders and any remaining collateral to JP holders.

## Step 10

Contract changes:

- `contracts/admin/LearningMultiSig.sol`
- transfer pool ownership to the multisig admin

Run:

```bash
cd pledgev2-rebuild
npm run test:step10
```

Learning goal:

- Replace single-admin execution with threshold approvals.
- Bind approvals to target, value, calldata hash, chain, multisig address, and nonce.
- Execute pool admin calls only after enough owners approve the exact action.

In interview, say:
```
I replaced single-owner admin control with an M-of-N multisig admin. 
The pool still uses onlyOwner, but ownership is transferred to the multisig contract. 
Admin actions are encoded as calldata, approved by multiple owners, and then executed by the multisig.
```
